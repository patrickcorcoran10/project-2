# project-2
Project 2 for NU Bootcamp

##
Our project is intended to be a mobile friendly, full stack web app intended to help users connect with restaurants in their current area. Think of Tinder for local restaurants. Our goal is to help people understand their neighborhood better, support local businesses and store restaurants they enjoy right in their pockets.

We will be utilizing the Yelp API to get the restaurant and rating data. We will be using user input to query the API. Mysql will serve as the backend database and express will handling the routing back and forth. Ideally we will be utilizing jQuery Mobile to make the site as mobile friendly as possible. This as well as some authentication middleware will make our site user specific.
